In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes a pre-trained molecular properties model (Uni-Mol) for rapid generation of molecular feature representations and integrates machine learning models for reaction prediction. 
1. We tested this framework on three different high-throughput experimentation (HTE) reaction datasets, and demonstrate results comparable to expert-designed DFT descriptors.
2. We synthesized a series of tetrapeptides that catalyze asymmetric aldol reactions under HTE conditions to generate a small-size dataset. 
3. With Uni-Mol representations, We trained a random forest classifier model to identify tetrapeptide catalysts exhibiting high yield and enantioselectivity.
