## HTE-Pred

This folder containes the validation the generally applicability of our approach, we selected three HTE datasets includes Buchwaldâ€“Hartwig reactions reported by Ahneman et al, Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions reported by Perera et al and Thiol addition reactions reported by Zahrt et al. The representations of each reaction component were computed using the pre-trained Uni-Mol model and then concatenated with condition descriptors to form reaction feature tensors. Each dataset were test using random 70/30 split and run 10 times for evaluation.
